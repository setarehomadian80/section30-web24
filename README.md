# ⌨️ Typing Effect Project

This project demonstrates a smooth typing animation using vanilla JavaScript. The text appears and disappears in a typewriter style, leveraging `slice()` and `setInterval` methods. Built without any external libraries, it's a clean and elegant implementation — perfect for portfolio or learning purposes.
